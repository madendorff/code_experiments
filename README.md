Code Experiments

Random coding experiments spanning various aspects of data analytics, machine learning, decision automation and visualization. I am exploring and getting comfortable with a few disparate technologies, but there  is a common technology thread that runs through these experiments. Each of the experiments explores a foundational element of something that could help cut across the  vast and complex technology landscape that application developers navigate when building software that supports decision making. 
Currently on my radar: 
1. Jax for flexible and performant number crunching 
1. Web assembly as a unified way of defining application logic in the browser/edge and on the cloud/server
1. Immediate mode graphics and UI for human interaction
1. Entity component systems for composition and inversion of control
